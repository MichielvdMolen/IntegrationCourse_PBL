    "### 4.3.2 Extension 2: Stress functions for temperature, humidity and soil moisture.\n",
    "Most vegetation types change the opening of their stomates to regulate how much CO$_2$ they take from the atmosphere and how much water vapor they lose. When the stomates are open, other species, such as NH$_3$ and O$_3$, can also be exchanged. When referring to the resistance at the leaf level, we use the term stomatal resistance. For tall vegetation structures, the stomatal resistance varies between the top and lower vegetation levels. Thus, when referring to the resistance at the vegetation level we use the term canopy resistance $r_c$ (s m$^{-1}$). The canopy resistance accounts for those differences (i.e., the differences between the top and lower vegetation levels).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to model the canopy resistance. The first is the Jarvis approach. [Paul Jarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gordon_Jarvis) (1935-2013) studied how canopy resistance responds to atmospheric conditions (e.g., vapor pressure deficit, radiation and temperature) and soil conditions (e.g., soil moisture and nutrient availability). He came up with a model formulation which assumes that each vegetation type has an intrinsic minimum resistance when the stomates are fully opened in optimal conditions. This minimum resistance is increased when the vegetation experiences stress, e.g., when the air is dry and the vegetation needs to reduce water loss. [Jarvis (1976)’s](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1976.0035) formulation assumes that the vegetation response to each stress factor can be described by an independent multiplicative term. This makes the Jarvis approach simple to use and it also facilitates comparison between vegetation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">The second is the A-g$_s$ approach, where A stands for CO$_2$ assimilation and $g_s$ for canopy conductance, i.e., the inverse of canopy resistance (see e.g., [Jacobs and de Bruin, 1997](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/1520-0450%281997%29036%3C1663%3APRTAEA%3E2.0.CO%3B2), [Ronda et al., 2001](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/1520-0450%282001%29040%3C1431%3AROTCCI%3E2.0.CO%3B2)). This approach is based on newer scientific evidence that vegetation optimizes the stomatal resistance for the specific carbon uptake for minimal water loss. Some vegetation types respond rather different to environmental stress factors than others. For example, some species use water rather aggressively to grow faster, but at the risk of running out of water. Other species use water rather conservatively to prevent running out of water, but at the cost of growing slower (e.g., [van der Molen et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311000517?via%3Dihub)). Taking into account the water cost of carbon uptake requires continuous integration between water availability, water loss and carbon uptake capacity of the vegetation. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jarvis approach describes the canopy resistance as a minimum canopy resistance $r_{c,min}$ (s m$^{-1}$), which applies to optimal conditions. In stressed conditions, the actual canopy resistance $r_c$ (s m$^{-1}$) is larger than the minimum, depending on the stress terms $F_1$, $F_2$, ..., $F_n$:\n",

    "r_c = \\frac{r_{c,min}}{LAI F_1F_2...F_n}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The $LAI$ (m$^2$ m$^{-2}$) in the denominator is leaf-area index which implies that at each vegetation level $i$ with $LAI_i+1$, $r_c$ decreases linearly, which is arguably a simplistic approach, because lower levels may be shaded and cooler than higher layers. The stress functions $F_1$, ..., $F_n$ quantify the level of stress due to environmental processes. The stress functions are given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F_1 = \\frac{\\frac{r_{c,min}}{r_{c,max}}+f}{1+f}, \\\\\n",
    "F_2 = \\frac{1}{1+h_s[q_s(T_a)-q_a]}, \\\\\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $r_{c,min}$ and $r_{c,max}$ (s m$^{-1}$) are minimum and maximum canopy resistances, respectively. We will initially work only with $F_1$ for simplicity, while neglecting $F_2$ to $F_4$. In the equation for $F_1$, $f=0.55\\frac{R_g}{R_{gl}}\\frac{2}{LAI}$, where $R_g$ (W m$^{-2}$) is global radiation, $R_{gl}$ (W m$^{-2}$) is the minimum solar radiation necessary for photosynthesis (transpiration) to occur. <font color=\"blue\">Just to be complete, we give the descriptions of $F_2$ to $F_4$ too. In the equation for $F_2$, $h_s$ (-) is a parameter associated with the water vapour deficit, $T_a$ (K) is air temperature at reference level, $q_s$ and $q_a$ (g kg$^{-1}$ or kg kg$^{-1}$) are saturation and actual water vapor mixing ratios. They can be calculated as:\n",

    "q_a = RH\\cdot q_s,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_d = 287$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ and $R_v = 462$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ are the gass constants for dry air and water vapour, respectively, $p \\approx 1.1$ kPa is the air pressure at the sea level, and $RH$ (-) is the relative humidity. These parameters should be chosen in such a way that $F_2$ is a number between 1 and ~10. In the equation for $F_3$, $T_{ref}$ (K) is the optimal air temperature for photosynthesis, while $T_a$ (K) is the air temperature. Finally, in the equation for $F_4$, $\\theta$ (m$^3$ m$^{-3}$) is volumetric water content, while and $d_i$ and $d_{tot}$ (m) are the depth of soil layer i and the total root depth.</font> This formulation and a more detailed description can be found in [Kumar et al.
